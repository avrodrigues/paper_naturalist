Here you find the fundamental data to run the analysis in the main text and the suplementary material of the article **Species misidentification affects biodiversity metrics: dealing with this issue using the new R package *naturaList* **

This directory ir organized in subdirectories:  
  - data  
  - output  
  - script   
and also contain the RStudio project file at the main directory. 

In *data* you find the fundamental data to run the analysis. We highlight the **occ_df_kew.RData**, which is the reference dataset cited in the manuscript and the **especialistas_todos.csv**, which contains the list of specialists in the tribe Myrteae used in the main text. 

In *output* you find the output files of the analyses. In *script* you find the scripts to run the analysis. The scripts have numerical index to indicate the order you should run the scripts to reproduce the analysis. Since the *output* directory contains the results of each script runned, it is not mandatory that you run all scripts following the numerical order.
